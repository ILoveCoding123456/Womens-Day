            <h1 data-splitting id="H1">About</h1>
            <p>International Women’s Day (March 8) is a global day celebrating the historical, cultural, and political achievements of women. The day also observed in support of taking action against gender inequality around the world. We all know the world couldn’t run without women (we mean, just listen to Beyoncé). This is the day to appreciate their efforts! Organizations large and small come together to show women just how valuable they are in today’s society.</p>
            <h1 data-splitting>Color Symbolization</h1>
            <p>Purple, green and white are the colors of International Women's Day. Purple signifies justice and dignity. Green symbolizes hope. White represents purity, albeit a controversial concept. The colors originated from the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in the UK in 1908.</p>
            <h1 data-splitting>Supporting Women's Day</h1>
            <p>International Women's Day is not country, group, nor organization specific. No one government, NGO, charity, corporation, academic institution, women's network, or media hub is solely responsible for International Women's Day. The day belongs to all groups collectively everywhere. Gloria Steinem, world-renowned feminist, journalist and activist once explained "The story of women's struggle for equality belongs to no single feminist, nor to any one organization, but to the collective efforts of all who care about human rights."  So make International Women's Day your day and do what you can to truly make a positive difference for women.</p>
            <h1 data-splitting>Women's Day Needed?</h1>
            <p>Yes! There's no place for complacency. According to the World Economic Forum, sadly none of us will see gender parity in our lifetimes, and nor likely will many of our children. Gender parity will not be attained for almost a century. There's urgent work to do - and we can all play a part.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>Women’s History Month began as a local celebration in Santa Rosa, California. The Education Task Force of the Sonoma County (California) Commission on the Status of Women planned and executed a “Women’s History Week” celebration in 1978. The organizers selected the week of March 8 to correspond with International Women’s Day. The movement spread across the country as other communities initiated their own Women’s History Week celebrations the following year. In 1980, a consortium of women’s groups and historians—led by the National Women’s History Project (now the National Women's History Alliance)—successfully lobbied for national recognition. In February 1980, President Jimmy Carter issued the first Presidential Proclamation declaring the Week of March 8th 1980 as National Women’s History Week.  Subsequent Presidents continued to proclaim a National Women’s History Week in March until 1987 when Congress passed Public Law 100-9, designating March as “Women’s History Month.” Between 1988 and 1994, Congress passed additional resolutions requesting and authorizing the President to proclaim March of each year as Women’s History Month. Since 1995, each president has issued an annual proclamations designating the month of March as “Women’s History Month.” The National Women’s History Alliance selects and publishes the yearly theme. The theme for Women's History Month in 2021 captures the spirit of these challenging times. Since many of the women's suffrage centennial celebrations originally scheduled for 2020 were curtailed, the National Women's History Alliance is extending the annual theme for 2021 to "Valiant Women of the Vote: Refusing to Be Silenced.</p>

        <h1 data-splitting id="H3">Famous Women</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Stella Creasey (1977-present) As famous women in history go, this Labour MP caused a huge furore when she took her very young baby in a sling into the Commons. She was reprimanded for bringing the tot into the session. The issue has forced Parliament to review their rules. A keen campaigner for worker mother’s rights, Stella has constantly battled for better maternity care for MPs and has set up This Mum Votes to help support parents in politics. She is definitely worthy of a space on this, and every, International Women’s Day. Rose Ayling-Ellis (1994-present) When Eastenders actor Rose Ayling-Ellis joined Strictly Come Dancing in 2021, little did she know that she would not just be the first deaf contestant, but that she would also go on to win the show. In week eight, Rose and her dance partner Giovanni Pernice performed a Couples Choice dance that featured a period of silence, included as a tribute to the deaf community. Cited as the unmissable TV event of the year, Rose recently picked up the Inspirational Person of the Year at the Visionary Honour Awards. Kamala Harris (1964-present) Talk about girl power! When Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris to be his right hand woman, she made history four times over. Not only is she the first female Vice President of the United States, but also the first black and South Asian American VP. It’s not the milestone she’s broken either – she was the first Black female attorney general of California AND was the the first South Asian-American senator in US history. Phew! There are many more women to appreciate in Women's History Month and on Women's Day! These are just 3 of the women!</p>
